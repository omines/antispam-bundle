After running with the defaults for a bit you will have some idea of the kind of spam still getting through.</p> <p>Let\u2019s investigate some of the more invasive options available. For the following example, we\u2019re protecting the contact form of a local toy store operating in southern France.</p> <p>First of all, spammers are usually trying to sell you stuff, meaning they probably want to get you to head over to a forged or real website. So a contact form submission with several links in there is usually quite suspicious. For our toy store, we do expect someone to sometimes email a link, asking if we also stock the item. More than 1 is unlikely, more than 2 pretty much implausible.</p> <p>Spammers also have issues with \u201clingual targeting\u201d. It\u2019s really unlikely that a real customer would ever fill in our contact form in Russian or Hebrew (1). Spambots regularly do, so let\u2019s forbid that.</p> <ol> <li>The chosen scripts are random for the sake of example. In the real world you would choose which scripts to add based     on actual spam getting through your forms unscathed.</li> </ol> <p>Lastly, we\u2019re a toy store, not a software company or a digital agency. People will not send us snippets of HTML. Spambots regularly do, in lame attempts at XSS or phishing. We\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s not accepted.</p> <p>So let\u2019s create a new profile <code>contact</code> specifically for the website\u2019s contact form: config/packages/antispam.yaml<pre><code>antispam:\n    profiles:\n        contact:\n            # We'll keep the honeypot and timer, they're non-invasive and\n            # highly effective\n            honeypot: email_address # (1)!\n            timer:\n                min: 3\n                max: 14400 # (2)!\n\n            # Reject content containing HTML or BBCode markup\n            banned_markup: true\n\n            # Reject forms that consist for more than half of Cyrillic\n            # (Russian) or Hebrew text\n            banned_scripts:\n                scripts: ['cyrillic', 'hebrew']\n                max_percentage: 50\n\n            # Reject form fields containing more than 2 URLs, or repeating\n            # identical URLs\n            url_count:\n                max: 2\n                max_identical: 1\n</code></pre></p> <ol> <li>Remember that the field name will automatically become <code>email_address1</code> or a higher number in case of a naming conflict.</li> <li>Toy stores attract kids , and they may get distracted or go away. Allowing 4 hours for a response might be fair!</li> </ol> <p>What happens now when you apply the <code>contact</code> profile to your contact form type:</p> <ul> <li>Your form will get automatically get 2 hidden fields injected:<ul> <li>A Honeypot called <code>email_address</code>, that will fail the form if it contains any value on submit.</li> <li>A Submit Timer cryptographically verifying the number of seconds between retrieving and   posting the form. Many spambots either submit a form within a single second, as they are in a rush to attack   millions of other sites, or they store the form so they can submit it hours, days or weeks later. The timer ensures   that the form is posted with a delay that is reasonable for a human filling it in, without spending days to do so.</li> </ul> </li> <li>All text fields on the form will get some extra validators injected:<ul> <li>A BannedMarkup validator that ensures no content that attempts to (ab)use HTML or   BBCode features is allowed.</li> <li>A BannedScripts validator blocks all fields which consist for at least 50% of   Cyrillic or Hebrew characters.</li> <li>A URLCount validator will block form submission if any of its text fields constain more   than 2 URLs, or if a single URL is repeated more than once. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Always consider carefully what is normal on your specific site!</p> <p>All anti-spam measures can backfire at some point, and trigger false positives that may hurt your or your client\u2019s interests. Blocking all Cyrillic (Russian) text in the contact form of a translation agency is a really bad idea.  Blocking all links also means your new sales opportunity can\u2019t say \u201cI want to have a similar site to  https://example.org\u201d. Even banning the phrase \u201cWE SELL VIAGRA\u201d could theoretically block someone requesting commercial help with a spammer sending them that message every hour.</p> <p>Be prudent about the measures you implement, and try to err on the side of caution. Remember that it\u2019s better to receive a single uncaught spam email per week than to lose a valuable customer every month.</p>"},{"location":"quickstart/#read-more","title":"Read more","text":"<ul> <li>Details on available features</li> <li>Configuration options</li> </ul>"},{"location":"form/honeypot/","title":"HoneypotType Field","text":"<p>The <code>HoneypotType</code> field is a text field being rendered invisible in your forms.
