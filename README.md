You have found the Swiss Army Knife of battling form spam in your Symfony application!

This bundle provides a ton of different mechanisms for detecting and stopping spammers, scammers and abusers
using your forms for their nefarious purposes, and brings them all together in an easy to configure profile system.

This bundle is compatible with PHP 8.1+ and Symfony 6.3 or later.

## Documentation

Extensive documentation can be found at https://omines.github.io/antispam-bundle/

## What does it do

This bundle provides you with a ton of methods to easily combat spam through tested and proven methods:

- *Honeypot*: hidden field to bait spammers
- *Timer*: Rejects forms being submitted too fast or too slow
- *Banned scripts*: Reject forms containing characters in specific scripts (ie. Cyrillic or Arabic)
- *Banned markup*: Rejects forms containing (attempts at) HTML or BBCode
- *Banned phrases*: Reject forms containing predefined phrases
- *URL Count*: Reject forms with too many URLs or repeated URLs in the content

All components can either be used standalone or deployed through easily configured antispam profiles.

## Development

This bundle is in active development, but most of its current API is considered stable. Releases follow
semantic versioning, and you can therefore safely upgrade without hitting breaking changes when using
proper caret constraints in Composer.

The bundle is *not* feature complete, and its API may change before reaching version 1.0.
[The major version is therefore 0 for now](https://omines.github.io/antispam-bundle/#why-not-a-stable-version-number).
